The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed a monitoring system in 26 food crisis countries to better understand the impacts of various shocks on agricultural livelihoods, food security and local value chains. The Monitoring System consists of primary data collected from households on a periodic basis (more or less every four months, depending on seasonality). Data are collected through Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and in-person surveys where the circumstances allow for field access. As the system is developed, the information collected and analyzed is being used to guide strategic decisions, to design programmes and to inform analytical processes such as the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) and the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO). At the core of the system is a standardized household questionnaire administered to around 150,000 households per year across the 26 countries. Standardization permits comparisons across time and space, considerably enhancing the utility of the data for decision makers. At minimum the household data are representative at Admin 1 level (e.g. province, or region) and in frequent cases at Admin 2 level (e.g. district). In each aggregated field, the values indicate the frequencies of the different responses, expressed as a weighted percentage of the total sample. \n\n---\n\n[8] [Unknown] Sudan Emergency: New arrivals from Sudan (Source: UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency). Following the outbreak of armed conflict in Sudan on 15 April 2023, large numbers of civilians have been forced to flee, including people who were already internally displaced because of previous conflicts in Sudan and refugees from other countries who had sought safety in Sudan. In addition to new internal displacement, hundreds of thousands of people, including Sudanese refugees and refugees of other nationalities hosted by Sudan have fled Sudan to neighbouring countries or returned home in adverse circumstances – notably to Chad, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Egypt and Ethiopia.

Afghanistan hosts a protracted population of Pakistani refugees, who fled North Waziristan Agency in 2014 as a result of a joint military offensive by Pakistani government forces against non-state armed groups. As of May 2017, UNHCR has biometrically registered over 50,000 refugees in Khost province and 36,000 refugees in Paktika province, where access remains a challenge. Over 16,000 of these refugees receive shelter and essential services in the Gulan camp in Khost province, while most of the others live among the host population in various urban and rural locations. To better understand the needs of the refugees and the host communities, UNHCR and WFP agreed to conduct a joint assessment of Pakistani refugees in Khost and Paktika. The data collection commenced in May 2017 and covered 2,638 refugee households (2,198 in Khost and 440 in Paktika).\n\n---\n\n[10] [Unknown] Lebanon - Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon, 2018 (Source: UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency). The Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR-2018) was conducted jointly by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP, dataviz.vam.wfp.org). Now in its sixth year, the Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) assesses a representative sample of Syrian refugee families to identify changes and trends in their situation. The Government of Lebanon estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees who have fled their country’s conflict since 2011 (including nearly one million registered with UNHCR as of end of September 2018). The Syrian refugee population in Lebanon remains the largest concentration of refugees per capita and the fourth largest refugee population in the world. VASyR includes a sample of 4,446 Syrian refugee households from 26 districts across Lebanon. The assessment demonstrates that despite the large scale assistance and the efforts of Lebanon and its partners that have resulted in improvements in economic vulnerability and stabilization in education, food security and some improvements in the situation for women, girls and female-headed households, Syrian refugees still remain very vulnerable. The economic context remains precarious and the protection needs to persist.", "ts": 1771762855.4474814}
